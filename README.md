# Make a CSV to use in a docs sprint

A simple Python script that collects all Markdown files in a directory tree, extracts documents titles, and outputs a CSV file suitable for organising a sprint to update the documents.

In addition to the path and title for each document, the CSV contains a "R-A-G" (red-amber-green) column and "Assignee" column for assessing the state of the document and assigning work on the document.
